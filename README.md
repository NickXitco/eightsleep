# Possible TODOs

- Smooth out some animations by doing the graph library by hand
- Divide the "stat wheel" border into different slices based on sleep state, have those animate when selecting the sleep state on the main chart and vice versa
- Add a react router, right now it just stores your current page in local storage.
